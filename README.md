### Requirements

```
docker
# If you're on a older version of docker, you will need to download docker-compose as well
```

### How to run
```
clone https://github.com/DeaSTL/flappybird-htmx
cd flappybird-htmx
#run...
docker compose up
# or if you're on a version without compose
docker-compose up
```
Then connect to `localhost:3200` in your browser


### Why....
```
I'm just trying to abuse htmx....
Actually I was just curious as to what's possible with htmx.
```


### Future plans?
1. Scoreboard systems
2. Multi-region deployment that won't bankrupt me
3. WebSocket use to reduce latency
4. Render optimizations
